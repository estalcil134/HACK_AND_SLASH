This is where admins will go to when they want to create a challenge. 
This page contains a form that will take in a challenge name, a challenge description, at most one file pertaining to the challenge, and a flag. All fields except for the file are required and when the admin user submits the challenge, the challenge name is first checked to prevent duplicate challenge names, then the challenge information is stored as a text file on our server in /user/challenges/challenges/ folder. If the admin uploaded a file as well, the file will be stored in /admin/challenge_creation_page/uploaded_docs/ folder with a very unique and obfuscated name.
If the challenge is successfully created, there will be a redirect back to this page and there will be an alert of having successfully created the challenge. If the challenge already existed, there would be an alert saying that the challenge already exists.

Visit /resources/challenge_creation_page/ folder for the CSS and JavaScript file
Note that the upload php file is in /resources/general/upload.php
