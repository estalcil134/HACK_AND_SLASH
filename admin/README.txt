This is the folder containing most of the admin resources. Here, an admin can create tutorials, delete tutorials they've made, create challenges, and delete challenges they've made. 
There is overhead to check if the user is truly and admin and if they are not, they are redirected to the login page to deal with another redirect.
The page uses a PHP require to include the normal header for all users and then outputs a total of eight navbar options for the admin to choose from. This is only the landing page and there is not much content for the admin other than what is offered in the navbar which we used to populate the center of the page.

Visit /resources/admin_home/ for the CSS file.
