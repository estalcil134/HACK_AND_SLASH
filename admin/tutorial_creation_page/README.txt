In the tutorial creation page the admin is allowed to create a tutorial of up 
to 20 files. We limited this file number so that tutorial sizes don't become immense
which would load down the website wit too many files. If the admin wants to create 
more tutorials with that content then we trust OUR admins to be responsible for now. We 
can alsways delete their tutorials if need be. There is no editing of the tutorial once it has
been fully created however, and must be deleted and created again if the admin wants to change
their tutorial. We also ensure that the file size isn't too large, is of the file type html/htm,
and has no uploading errors. We even give instructions in the metatutorial on how to create a 
tutorials, with some smaller instructions on the actual tutorial creation page itself for the
admin. We make sure the admin actually has files to create the tutorial, and tell them if they 
trying to create a tutorial with no htmls to provide content. The admin can upload html they 
have made with extra dynamic elements with nice embedded css and/or JavaScript, or have just
created by saving their Microsoft Word document as an html. The admin can also create question
pages for their tutorial when they go to the question creator part of the tutorial creation page.
Here they can make a short answer question, or make a multiple choice question with two to five
questions. The admin can also see their question displayed and in a demo so they can see if the
question is what they want. The admin can see all of the files they have created or uploaded on 
the page constantly, and can preview what the html of each page looks like when they click on that
specific page. If the admin wants to get rid of any of the pages they can click the "DELETE" button
for that tutorial page, which gets rid of that particular page for the admin. Then they can 
create that question page to be apart of the entire tutorial. Once all of the pages for the
tutorial have been uploaded or created, the admin can then drag the pages to create a different 
order, which allows for the final submission. At this point the admin can submit the entire tutorial 
with a tutorial name, which is automatically made in the tutorials page. The admin can then go to the 
tutorials page and try their own tutorial out. This folder contains all of the php files to create
and run all of the tutorial creation processes. This does not include any resources like css, images,
Javascript, or jQuery. It also includes the folder for uploaded documents for each of the pages, and
each admin has their own folder in the uploaded_docs folder to make their own tutorial. (these admin
folders are made when an admin actually starts creating tutorials)
