        <h2>Creating a Tutorial</h2>
        <p>To create a tutorial, the Admin must go to the Tutorial Creation page from the Admin home page. From there, the admin must
				choose whether they will create a tutorial or question. If admin chooses to create a tutorial:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Admin must upload a HTML document through the file upload button. Instructions to convert from a
					Microsoft Word Document to html file format are on the page.</li>
					<li>Each time the Admin uploads a file, it will appear in the preview section where they are then able to move sections
					around to their liking as well as preview it by pressing on the file box.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If the Admin wants to add a question to the tutorial: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Admin must enter the question in the question input box</li>
					<li>Then they must choose if it will be a short answer or multiple choice</li>
					<li>If it is a short answer question, they must then add the answer</li>
					<li>If it is a multiple choice question, they must select how many choices there will be and what will be in each choice</li>
					<li>After question is completed, Admin must press the "Create Question Page" button to send it to the preview section</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					When Admin is done making changes, they must press the "Submit" button to finalize changes and post the tutorial.
				</p>
				<p>
					NOTE: When submitting an HTML file, make sure the styles and scripts are embedded into the HTML file with no external references
					      to your local filepath. This is to prevent the console errors in the iframes for previewing a tutorial to be created and
					      when accessing a created tutorial.
				</p>
        <h2>Deleting a Tutorial</h2>
        <p>To delete a tutorial, the admin must go to the Tutorial Deletion link from the Admin Home Page. From there it is a
				simple process. The admin must select which tutorial they want to delete by pressing the "delete" button on the right of the tutorial. A popup will
			then appear confirming to the admin that they are trying to delete the tutorial. </p>

				<h2>Creating a Challenge</h2>
				<p>
					To create a challenge, the admin must go to the Challenge Creation link from the Admin Home Page. From there the
					page will load with several fields to complete for the creation of a challenge. From there the Admin must:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Enter a challenge name</li>
					<li>Enter a description for the challenge</li>
					<li>Upload any files required for the challenge through the file upload button </li>
					<li>Enter the flag that the user must obtain to recieve points for the challenge</li>
					<li>A challenge preview section will appear with which each section that the Admin inputted</li>
				</ul>
				<p>After completing each section and previewing the challenge, Admin must press the "Submit" button to post the challenge.</p>

				<h2>Deleting a Challenge</h2>
				<p>To delete a challenge, it is very similar to the tutorial deletion. The Admin must press the "delete" button next to the
				challenge and confirm the deletion through the pop-up that appears. </p>
