This page is the landing page for users who want to browse the available tutorials. 
It is a page that admins and registered users are able to view by design so both admins and users are able to view the tutorials available on the website. Each user has a bitstring relating to the tutorials they do. After the navbars are loaded in through "require" there is a query to first grab all the currently existing tutorials from the database, then to grab the user's tutorial bit string. The user's tutorial bitstring length is compared to the total number of existing tutorials, and if the bitstring is too short then '0''s are appended to the bitstring until the tutorial bitstring is of equal length as the total number of existing tutorials. We insert '0' because '0' means that the user has not completed the tutorial yet and '1' means the user completed that tutorial. Since the user's tutorial bitstring is not up to date, that means that a tutorial was added while the user was not logged in, so it would be a new tutorial for that user. We then send the updated tutorial bitstring to store for that user. 
After updating the tutorial bitstring, the code sifts through all the tutorials that were queried for earlier and separates the tutorials into a completed array and an incomplete array -- actually two arrays since one is used to store the name of the tutorial while a second one is used to store the link to that tutorial e.g. $complete stores the names for completed tutorials and $c_link stores the links to the respective tutorials in order. They are sorted based on whether the tutorial bitstring at the $i character is a '0' for incomplete or a '1' for completed.
A table is then outputted with two columns, one column for completed tutorials and another for tutorials the user has yet to touch.

Note: If there are no tutorials, a message will be outputted saying that tutorials will be coming soon instead of serving our users our site wallpaper leaving them in a confused state.
