        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>HACK&/ is focused on creating a more efficient process to learn more about cybersecurity topics through interactive tutorials and lessons.</p>
        
        <h2>The Why</h2>
        <p>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has an prodigious club called RPISEC, which helps students learn about and utilize cybersecurity. The club is made of very experienced members who help other students get into white hat hacking. However, there is a level of experience students need in order to benefit and learn from RPISEC. Therefore, RPISEC made a secondary club, IntroSec, in order to lead inexperienced students into the cybersecurity world. RPISEC has made substantial progress in helping those novice hackers into the club, however there is still a steep learning curve. <br><br>
        It is hard to find the right tools, documentation, and tricks to start learning about cyber security, which is why HACK&/ is making a website to give these resources to students. HACK&/’s objective is to give users a website where: they can learn about multiple cybersecurity topics in a tutorial, answer questions about what they learned to cement what they’ve read, and then practice their newfound skills in some challenges. The challenges will have scores so that users can see their progress in the challenges by seeing how many points they have on a scoreboard page. Admins will be the “teachers” of the website, who can create or delete tutorials and challenges, tailoring the website to create a better learning experience. HACK&/ will help people begin their journey of becoming experienced in the cybersecurity field.
